## Site Frequency Spectrum

MSMS and SLiM simulations appeared to be different due to the difference in accuracies (although Imagene appeared to 
be behaving the same way in both cases), so we decided to explore how they might be different.

This folder was created to gain a better understanding of the different types of simulations and if they

1. Accurately represent the same populations (msms vs slim)
2. If they accurately represent human populations

To do so, we compared the SLIM and MSMS software neural and selective sweep simulations (S=0.01) by

1. Computing the mean and standard deviations of the width of simulated images
2. Plot the site frequency spectrum and folded site frequency spectrum
3. Plot the folded site frequency spectrum from chromosome 20 of the thousand genomes project for two different populations
