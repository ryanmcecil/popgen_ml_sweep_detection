## Reproducing Results

Each directory contains the py files necessary to reproduce appropriate results.

### Imagene

#### MSMS
1. Reproduction of full Imagene model performance with selection coefficient of 0.01. 
Performance depicted by generated confusion matrices.
2. Reproduction of 'Tiny' Imagene model performance with selection coefficient of 0.01. 
Performance depicted by generated confusion matrices. Visualization of layer weights learned and layer outputs for
each model.
3. Reproduction of summary statistic performance on selection coefficient of 0.01. Comparison of summary statistic
performance to 'tiny' Imagene model
