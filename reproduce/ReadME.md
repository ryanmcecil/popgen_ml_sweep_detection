# Reproducing Results

Each directory contains the py files necessary to generate the raw csv and plot data used for different projects. To reproduce all results, call

```
bash reproduce.sh
```

The following directories are used for

- *imagene_results*: Reproduce results from the [Imagene](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-019-2927-x) paper with both [MSMS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2916717/) and [SLiM](https://messerlab.org/slim/).
