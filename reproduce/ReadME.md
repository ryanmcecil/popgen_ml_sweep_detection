# Reproducing Results

Each directory contains the `.py` files necessary to generate the raw csv and plot data. In each folder, there exists a `reproduce.sh` file detailing which files should be called in order to reproduce all results. The code in each directory are used to:

- *article*: reproduce the results from our recent [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.26.530156v1). These results include and expand upon on the initial results from my master's thesis. 
- *imagene_results*: reproduce results from the [Imagene](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-019-2927-x) paper with both [MSMS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2916717/) and [SLiM](https://messerlab.org/slim/).
