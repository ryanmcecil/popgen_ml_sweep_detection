The `reproduce.sh` file may be used to generate the results of this directory. The code in this directory was written to reproduce a few of the results from the Imagene paper using MSMS and SLiM simulations. A description of each directory is below.

#### MSMS

Reproduction of full Imagene model performance with selection coefficient of 0.01. Performance depicted by generated confusion matrices.

#### SLiM

Reproduction of full Imagene model performance with selection coefficient of 0.01. Performance depicted by generated confusion matrices.
