The `reproduce.sh` file may be used to generate the results of this directory. The code in this directory was writtent to reproduce a few of the results from the Imagene paper using MSMS and SLiM simulations. A description of each directory is below.

#### MSMS
1. Reproduction of full Imagene model performance with selection coefficient of 0.01. 
Performance depicted by generated confusion matrices.
2. Reproduction of 'tiny' Imagene model performance with selection coefficient of 0.01. 
Performance depicted by generated confusion matrices. Visualization of layer weights learned and layer outputs for
each model.
3. Reproduction of summary statistic performance on selection coefficient of 0.01. Comparison of summary statistic
performance to 'tiny' Imagene model

#### SLiM
1. Reproduction of full Imagene model performance with selection coefficient of 0.01. 
Performance depicted by generated confusion matrices.
2. Reproduction of 'tiny' Imagene model performance with selection coefficient of 0.01. 
Performance depicted by generated confusion matrices. Visualization of layer weights learned and layer outputs for
each model.
3. Reproduction of summary statistic performance on selection coefficient of 0.01. Comparison of summary statistic
performance to 'tiny' Imagene model
